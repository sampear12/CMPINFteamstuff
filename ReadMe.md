What my software does:

My software is simply designed to calculate and return your taxes with respect to your income and tax percentage.

How to install my software:

Since my software is not an app, you will need to install a text editor or you can simply run my program using the jupyter hub command line. 

Usage Documentation:

The user needs to input their yearly income as well as the tax percentage they want to use to calculate their taxes. After doing so, my program will automatically run, calculate and print the taxes they owe.
